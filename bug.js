This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This commonly happens when fetching data from an API and the data hasn't loaded yet or when dealing with optional chaining where the chain is broken.

```javascript
// Example causing error
const myObject = null; // or undefined
console.log(myObject.someProperty);
```

This will result in a TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'someProperty').
